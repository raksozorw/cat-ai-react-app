# Overview

This app is built to upload images and send a webcam stream (WIP) to my cat-ai API. The API uses a model I've trained to differentiate between images of my two cats, Jarlsberg and Kvarg.

# To Run:

To run a preview, just run `npm run dev`.

Builds are done automatically by AWS Amplify when changes are made to `main`.
